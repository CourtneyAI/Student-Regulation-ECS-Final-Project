            Hello everyone! Today, we will present "Chapter 4: Offenses and Categories" from the Student Regulation Book. 
            This chapter talks about different kinds of rule-breaking, called offenses. Each offense has its own level;
            some are small, some are more serious, and some are very serious.

            <h2>Main Categories:</h2>
            <p>There are three main categories of offenses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mild offenses – small mistakes</li>
                    <li>Moderate offenses – more serious actions</li>
                    <li>Severe offenses – very serious and harmful actions</li>
                </ul>
            Each category has examples and consequences. 
            Let’s start with the first one — Mild Offenses.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Mild Offenses</h3>
            <p> 
                Mild offenses are small mistakes that can happen because we are not careful.
                They are not very serious, but they still break school rules. Students should fix these mistakes quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of Mild Offenses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Coming late to school or class.</li>
                    <li>Not bringing school books or materials.</li>
                    <li>Not doing homework.</li>
                    <li>Eating or drinking in class.</li>
                    <li>Wearing too many accessories or jewelry.</li>
                    <li>Using a phone or gadget in class without permission.</li>
                    <li>Playing games or sports during class time.</li>
                    <li>Talking or disturbing the class while the teacher is speaking.</li>
                    <li>Sleeping in class.</li>
                    <li>Not keeping the classroom clean.</li>
                    <li>Forgetting to greet teachers or staff.</li>
                    <li>Running in the hallway or shouting loudly.</li>
                    <li>Not wearing a mask or proper ID card.</li>
                </ul>
                These things might look small, but they show a lack of discipline.
                If a student keeps doing them, they can become moderate offenses.
            </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Moderate Offenses</h3>
        <body>
            Moderate offenses are more serious or happen when a student repeats mild offenses many times.
            These actions show that the student does not respect school rules or responsibilities.
        </body>
        <p>Here are some examples of Moderate Offenses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wearing the wrong or incomplete uniform.</li>
            <li>Leaving class or school without permission.</li>
            <li>Damaging or writing on school property.</li>
            <li>Using school facilities the wrong way, like projectors or classrooms.</li>
            <li>Removing or destroying school announcements or posters.</li>
            <li>Over-celebrating birthdays or events in school.</li>
            <li>Borrowing or lending money to other students.</li>
            <li>Skipping flag ceremony, devotions, or school events without reason.</li>
            <li>Ignoring teacher’s instructions.</li>
            <li>Cheating in homework or classwork.</li>
            <li>Being rude to teachers or classmates.</li>
            <li>Fighting with words or starting arguments.</li>
            <li>Coming to school with bad behavior or attitude.</li>
            <li>Lying to teachers or staff.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a student does these, the teacher or staff can give a warning, counseling, or other discipline actions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Severe Offenses:</h3>
        <body>
            Severe offenses are very serious rule-breaking actions.
            They can hurt people, damage property, or give the school a bad name.
            Students who do these can get strong punishment.
        </body>
        <p>Examples of Severe Offenses are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bullying, either physical, verbal, or online.</li>
            <li>Fighting inside or outside the school.</li>
            <li>Cheating during exams or copying other people’s answers.</li>
            <li>Bringing weapons, sharp objects, or dangerous tools to school.</li>
            <li>Bringing, using, or sharing drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes.</li>
            <li>Watching or spreading bad or inappropriate videos or photos.</li>
            <li>Stealing money, books, or other people’s things.</li>
            <li>Breaking into school rooms without permission.</li>
            <li>Damaging or changing school documents.</li>
            <li>Joining bad or criminal groups or gangs.</li>
            <li>Running away from school during school hours.</li>
            <li>Threatening teachers or students.</li>
            <li>Using fake excuses or lying to school staff.</li>
            <li>Doing any criminal act that breaks the law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Students who do these actions may get suspension or expulsion.
            These are very serious and can also affect their future.

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>
            This chapter reminds us that school rules are made to help us become better students.
            They are not there to punish us, but to teach us discipline and respect.
            When we follow the rules, we show that we care about our school and the people in it.
            We learn to be responsible, honest, and kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            By avoiding offenses, we make our school a safe and happy place for everyone.
